# Internal TestFlight operator runbooks

These runbooks operate PacePrompt's protected, internal-only TestFlight release
path. They do not submit to App Review, enable external testing, publish an App
Store version or test HealthKit or treadmill behaviour.

Use them in this order:

1. [One-time setup and credential rotation](setup.md) — Apple certificate,
   provisioning profile, App Store Connect API key, internal tester group,
   GitHub environment, secrets, variables and tag rules.
2. [Prepare and run a release](release.md) — choose a unique version/build,
   validate and review the source, merge it, create the protected tag, approve
   the environment job and verify each release stage.
3. [Failure recovery](troubleshooting.md) — determine whether an upload ran,
   avoid ambiguous retries, rotate expired credentials and recover with a new
   immutable tag when required.

The implementation and security rationale remain in
[`docs/internal-testflight-release.md`](../internal-testflight-release.md).
The workflow is [`.github/workflows/internal-testflight.yml`](../../.github/workflows/internal-testflight.yml).

## Fixed production identity

| Item | Expected value |
| --- | --- |
| App | Existing PacePrompt App Store Connect record |
| Bundle ID | `com.otherweather.PromptPace` |
| Tag | `testflight/<marketing-version>-b<build>` |
| GitHub environment | `internal-testflight` |
| Distribution | TestFlight internal testing only |
| Tester access | Existing explicit-assignment sole-tester group |
| Export method | `app-store-connect` with `testFlightInternalTestingOnly=true` |

Do not place a `.p8`, `.p12`, `.mobileprovision`, private key, certificate
password, decoded signing asset or IPA in Git, a pull request, an Actions
artifact, a terminal transcript or chat. Use synthetic values in examples and
tests.
